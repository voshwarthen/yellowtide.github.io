Markdeep is free and easy to use. It doesn't need a plugin, or
Internet connection. There's nothing to install. Just start
writing in Vi, Nodepad, Zed, Emacs, Visual Studio, Atom, or another
editor! You don't have to export, compile, or otherwise process
your document.

If you want to support development of Markdeep, you can
[sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/morgan3d) these projects on GitHub
for $2 or just buy my [Graphics Codex](http://graphicscodex.com) book for $10 on Amazon. 
Revenue from the book funds my open source projects.
